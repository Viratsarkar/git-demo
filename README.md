# Git & GitHub Practice Repository

Welcome! This repository is my personal practice area for learning the fundamentals of **Git** and **GitHub**.

## Purpose of this Project

I created this project to get hands-on experience with the most common Git commands. The files and commit history you see are the result of me learning how to:

* Initialize a new repository
* Add files to the staging area (`git add`)
* Create new commits with messages (`git commit`)
* Push local commits to a remote repository on GitHub (`git push`)

## About the Files

The files in this repository (such as `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt`, etc.) are simple placeholders. They don't contain any important code.

Their only purpose was to give me something to practice the **add -> commit -> push** workflow. The commit history, with messages like "First Commit" and "add file3," reflects this learning process.
